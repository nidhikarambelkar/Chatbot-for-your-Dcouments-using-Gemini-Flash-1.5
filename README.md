The "Chatbot for Your Documents" is an interactive application developed using Streamlit. It allows users 
to upload PDF or TXT files, processes the content into a structured format, and provides answers to user 
queries based on the uploaded documents. The system uses FAISS for efficient text retrieval and integrates 
Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate context-aware and accurate answers.
